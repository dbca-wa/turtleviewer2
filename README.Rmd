Interactive turtle data preview for QA and analysis hosted at 
<https://turtledata.dbca.wa.gov.au/> for DBCA staff.

## Architecture
Data shapshots are locally saved as an `.rds` file for WAStD data, WAMTRAM data, 
and WAStD sites. 
The app accesses these snapshots through file paths relative to its working directory, e.g. `here:here("inst/wastd_site.rds")`.

In development, the workdir is the top level folder of the app's source code, 
and `inst` refers to that folder inside the source code.

In production, the `WORKDIR` is defined as `/app` in the Dockerfile, and 
data snapshots are written to `/app/inst` in the running container.

To persist the data snapshots, a volume should be mounted to the internal path
`/app/inst`. 

## Development
* Write code, add tests where needed
* Update dependencies from code: `attachment::att_amend_desc()` (careful: drops unused Imports)
* Update Dockerfile from dependencies: `golem::add_dockerfile(from="rocker/geospatial:4.1.2")`
  (careful: rotate existing Dockerfile to Dockerfile_old to keep manual edits)
* Build Docker image for local testing: `system("docker build . -t dbca-wa/turtleviewer2:latest")`
* Run e.g. through [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io) with 
  * Name: e.g. "tv"
  * Image: advanced mode, `dbca-wa/turtleviewer2:latest`
  * Always pull image: off
  * Publish ports: on
  * Volumes: container path `/app/inst`, use named volume or bind mount to a local
    directory
  * env: paste environment variables from your .env (warning: sensitive credentials).
    A template is given at `inst/.env.template`.
* If the Docker image does not work, inspect the docker logs, 
  or debug with `docker run -it dbca-wa/turtleviewer2:latest /bin/bash -c "export TERM=xterm; exec bash"`.
  The console runs inside the Docker container, bypassing the Shiny app.
  There, you can run R and test whether all libraries (especially `turtleviewer2`)
  load successfully.
* If the app as well as the Docker image work, commit and push.


## Deployment
Once app and Docker image work, create a new version, tag, and push the tag.
```
# One of these (R console)
usethis::use_version(which="patch")
usethis::use_version(which="minor")
usethis::use_version(which="major")

# Create a git tag (terminal) - use the current version
git tag -a 'v0.0.1' -m 'v0.0.1'
git push --tags
```

Pushing a new tag will build and publish a new Docker image to the GitHub container registry.

In the Rancher console, edit the "turtleviewer" workload and update the image
to the latest tag.
